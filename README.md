jHERE Playground
===

[Live Demo](http://bin.jhere.net)

A simple interactive playground to let you make and share maps easily using the [jHERE plugin](http://jhere.net).

Maps can be saved as anonymous [Gists](https://gist.github.com/) or downloaded as a single HTML file.

This project can be reused for any JS project just by changing the default HTML, CSS and JS files in `public/default`

Highlighting is done with [Codemirror](http://codemirror.net/) and the theme is a mix of PrismJS's default, Monokai and a couple of other things.
